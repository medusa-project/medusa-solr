##Shared solr core for medusa services.

Within a `solr-5.2.1/` directory created by extracting an archive downloaded from (solr 5.2.1 download site)[http://ftp.wayne.edu/apache/lucene/solr/5.2.1/], copy this solr directory into the `server/` directory.  The resulting structure will be `solr-5.2.1/server/solr/medusa`.
